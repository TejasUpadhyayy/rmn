              Imagine going from being a literal highway robber to dropping the hottest story of all time. 
              That's Valmiki's glow-up story! Man really said "new year, new me" and became the first-ever 
              poet. Talk about character development! 💫

              Bro didn't even have Google Docs or Grammarly, yet wrote 24,000 verses that slap harder than 
              any modern playlist. He literally invented a whole new meter called "Anushtubh" - basically the 
              ancient equivalent of dropping a new music genre 🎵

              <li>• Legend says he meditated so long, an anthill formed around him (original touch grass moment)</li>
              <li>• Wrote the whole Ramayana before it even happened (major spoiler alert energy)</li>
              <li>• Created the first-ever "thread" - but instead of Twitter, he used poetry</li>
              <li>• His work has more plot twists than all of Netflix combined</li>

              My man Valmiki really created a story so fire it's been viral for thousands of years without 
              any social media promotion. No PR team, no marketing budget, just pure storytelling skills. 
              That's the kind of influence we're all trying to achieve on Instagram fr fr 👑
